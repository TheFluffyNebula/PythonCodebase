---get the action to communicate with the grid (draw something new, etc)---

hide the turtle(s) and set them to teleport during the iterations
    subtask for waaaay later: animation (visually move as in redraw every pixel the agent moves)

make grid class have a method that counts tiles cleaned? (currently in main)

testcase automation? (options not mutually exclusive)
option 1: test files w/ custom file paths like with the Java ver.
option 2: string concatenation, then pass the file path into grid()
