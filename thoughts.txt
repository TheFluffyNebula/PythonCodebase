some ideas:
file i/o to generate the maps

functions to implement:
drawGrid (use calls to drawSquare with i & j loops)
drawSquare(x, y, color)
drawAgent(x, y) -- clears and redraws the agent in square (x, y)
--secondary task--: replace movement with animation?

plans for the agent:
left, right, up, down
DIRECTIONS = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
LEFT = 0
RIGHT = 1
UP = 2
DOWN = 3
* make a class/enum called directions so we can imitate directions left/right/up/down?
CLEAN = 4?
agentOperation(direction)

test automation:
pass in string=s to function, with open(s) as fin:...

config file to adjust parameters? then read in the file to adjust the global variables

tile coloring scheme:
0 = clean
1 = dirty
2 = wall

---maintain extensibility for future problem sets?---
