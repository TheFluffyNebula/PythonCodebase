some ideas:
file i/o to generate the maps

functions to implement:
drawGrid (use calls to drawSquare with i & j loops)
drawSquare(x, y, color)
drawAgent(x, y) -- clears and redraws the agent in square (x, y)
--secondary task--: replace movement with animation?

plans for the agent:
up, down left, right
DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]
UP = 0
DOWN = 1
LEFT = 2
RIGHT = 3
* make a class called directions so we can imitate directions.up/down/left/right?
CLEAN = 4?
agentOperation(direction)

test automation:
pass in string=s to function, with open(s) as fin:...


---maintain extensibility for future problem sets?---
